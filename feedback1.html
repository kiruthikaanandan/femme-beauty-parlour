<img src="i2.jpeg" alt="image not found" height="30%" width="25%" align="left"/><div class="joes"><ul><li> I visited femme's Salon in Doveton,  Chennai for straightening and coloring my hair, the guy Kishore who did my hair straightening left
the chemical on my hair for 45 min when actually it should be on my hair for 17 min tops. He then over heated the straightener and burned me
whole head of hair. They charged me 13, 000 Rs.</li>

<li>I went home sad.  The next day I went to another Naturals and enquired about what should be done,  they told me that the hair is 
burned badly and that nothing can be done.</li>

<li>I'd have to grow out the hair till my natural hair is grown, then I have to cut off the burnt hair. I didn't tell them who did this to 
my hair but they said some untrained person or stupid person had done this to your hair. And yet this Kishore guy told me he got trained by 
Loreal in Adyar.by <b>judko_feruka</b></li></ul></div>

for discounted service as the branch was newly opened and since it is it is not so far I decided to visit to do a Hair spa for myself .
yes, I am actually pretty happy with the service they provided for my hair.<br></li>

<li>What I like - 1. The procedure they follow it very perfectly for the hair spa. 2. staff is friendly and does the service with ease. 3. 
ambience and atmosphere is good.<br></li>

<li>what I dislike 1. The charge for the service is a bit expensive when compared to other salonThe staffs are well trained there and are really
professional and dedicated to their work . by <b>FRANCY</b></li></ul></div><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<img src="i4.jpeg" alt="image not found" height="30%" width="25%" align="left"/><div class="pink"><ul><li>I can't say no) I argued n argued n finally
 spoke through phone with the concerned person in saloon at Arumbakkam and got I free.they made my home nasty and ackward .naturals don't
 even bring a sheet to put it in floor.moreover the girl was asking me to bring the stool, water each and every time .she wants me to take 
 the waste& throw it in dustbin.is this the way to behave to customers? Pamperazi/ zaplauk home saloon was awesome.they don't trouble us.they
 bring everything with them, don't make our home nasty, bring even portable stool with them& behave so decent.</li>

<li>When I asked her, she told me arrogant that they will not bring any such things with them.then y d hell r you running a home saloon?the
 prices are too high.they gave me only 10 mins massage against the promised time of 20 mins.moreover in naturals, they don't have hair wash.
 Please don't opt for naturals.they irritate u to the core .with an indecent behaviour at your home.in short, they don't even have the
 necessary equipments needed for a home visit.<b>ROOPALEY</b></li>
