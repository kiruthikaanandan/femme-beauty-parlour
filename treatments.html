<h3><ul><li>Facials may include the use of a facial mask.
Massage for the body is a popular beauty treatment, with various techniques offering benefits to the skin 
(including the application of beauty products) and for increasing mental well-being. Hair removal is offered at 
some beauty salons through treatments such as waxing and threading. Some beauty salons style hair instead of going to a 
separate hair salon, and some also offer sun tanning. Other treatments of the face are known as facials.</li>
 
<li>Specialized beauty salons known as nail salons offer treatments such as manicures and pedicures for the nails.
 A manicure is a treatment for the hands, incorporating the fingernails and cuticles and often involving the application of nail polish,
 while a pedicure involves treatment of the feet, incorporating the toenails and the softening or removal of calluses.</li>
 
 <h1>Weight loss:</h1><li> Massage is known to increase mobility and speed recovery from overdoing it at the gym. 
 “The natural form of therapy also improves circulation and the supply of nutrients to the muscles.
 After muscles are exercised, vital nutrients must be supplied to them so that they can recover and rebuild themselves,
 ” says Colleen O’Conner, licensed massage therapist and franchise owner of Elements Massage in Louisville.
 Massage maximizes the supply of these nutrients and oxygen through increased blood flow, which helps the muscles grow and burn more calories.
 All that circulation and lymphatic drainage is great for fighting dreaded cellulite, as well!</li>

<h1>Better hair:</h1><li> Great for both men and women, weekly massages to the scalp also promote hair growth and health.
 “It also helps with blood flow that can decrease dry scalp, itching and dandruff. This can easily be done twice a week while washing hair 
 in the shower,” says Gabbard.</li>



<h1>Glowing skin:</h1><li> Massages and therapeutic body treatments don’t just pamper and relieve stress – they help improve circulation
 which enhances your skin’s glow. Blood flow increases significantly during a massage and plumps tired skin immediately.
 “Massages create glorious lymphatic drainage results that can add incredible vitality and glow to dull complexions,” says Gabbard.</li>

<h1>Improved sleep:</h1> <li>You may have a great night’s sleep after an hour of restorative yoga, and you will from massage
 for the same reasons. We’ve all dozed off on the massage table a few times. We’re relaxed, our blood is flowing better, 
 and our tensions have been eased — a recipe for some fabulous beauty sleep!</li>
